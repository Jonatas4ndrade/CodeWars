# Squares Check
### Task description:
Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

Remarks

    a or b might be [] or {} (all languages except R, Shell).
    a or b might be nil or null or None or nothing (except in C++, Crystal, D, Dart, Elixir, Fortran, F#, Haskell, Nim, OCaml, Pascal, Perl, PowerShell, Prolog, PureScript, R, Racket, Rust, Shell, Swift).

If a or b are nil (or null or None, depending on the language), the problem doesn't make sense so return false.
